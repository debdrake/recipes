<ol>
    <li>finely dice olives, jalepeno, and garlic - pulse on a quisinart works well, I start with the jalepeno, it seems to need more dicing.  I also cut out the seeds and spine, I don't like it too spicy.  </li>
    <li>drizzle with olive oil, mixing until you get a spreadable consistency.</li>
    <li>serve with french bread or crackers</li>
