    <li>1. Clean out chicken, then dry with paper towels.  Liberally sprinkle inside with salt and parsley.  Put in baking pan, and stuff both openings with apples, onions, and celery.  Lightly salt & pepper outside of chicken.  Bake in 350 deg. oven for 1 hour, or 325 deg. oven for 1 Â½  hours.  Every 15 minutes, take chicken out and rub a stick of butter all over outside of chicken. Serve with stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy.</li>
    <li>Gravy:  Drain out all but 2 Tablespoons of grease in baking dish, and add 2 tablespoons of flour.  Mix thoroughly with grease and cook until golden brown.  Add 2 Cups of chicken broth, stirring constantly. Best to add 1 cup of broth, stir with flour mix, then add the last cup gradually to get desired thickness -- you may not need all 2 cups.</li>
