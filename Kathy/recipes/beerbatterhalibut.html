<h1>Beer Batter Halibut</h1>
<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 lbs. halibut, chunked/li>
    <li>1 cup flour/li>
    <li>1/4  cup corn starch/li>
    <li>1 Tablespoon Lowry's seasoned salt/li>
    <li>12 oz beer/li>
    <li>Tartar Sauce<</li>
</ul>
<h2>METHOD</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mix dry ingredients (use the 1/8 c corn starch), then add beer.  Don't add the whole can, it will make batter too thin.  Add about 2/3 of the can, then mix and check for thickness.  It will thicken as it stands for a few minutes, but you want the consistency of pancake batter.</li>
    <li>Skin and wash halibut, dry in paper towels, then chunk in 2 inch squares.  Dip fish in 1/2 c corn starch, then batter, and fry in 1‚Äù deep hot oil until golden brown. Flip once, takes aprox 3 minutes. </li>
