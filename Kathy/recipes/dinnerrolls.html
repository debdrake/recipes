<h1>Dinner Rolls</h1>
<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>
    <li>- 2 c. warm water (warm, not hot)
- 5-6 c. flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons yeast</li>
    <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1/3 c. sugar</li>
    <li>1/3 c. milk</li>
    <li>1 egg, slightly beaten</li>
    <li>2 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
</ul>
<h2>METHOD</h2>
<ol>
    <li>1. Put the warm water and a tsp of the sugar in a bowl.  Stir in the yeast until it dissolves.  Cover with plastic wrap then let sit for 10-12 minutes until yeast starts reacting If the yeast doesn't react, throw it out and start over.</li>
    <li>Make dough - add the rest of the sugar, the oil, salt, milk and egg, along with 2 cups of the flour.  Beat until smooth.</li>
    <li>Add the next 2 to 2 1/2 cups of flour a half cup at a time. I use a stand mixer set on slow for a couple of minutes to mix, then turn it up to medium high. If the dough releases from the side of the bowl, then that is enough flour. If not, add 1/4 to a 1/2 cup more of flour, mix slow, then fast again. To finish kneading, continue to mix on med-high for 4-6 minutes. Turn out on a floured surface and roll in just enough dough to handle. It should be kinda sticky.  Put it in a  bowl*, and cover with plastic wrap and a towel. Let rise for 1 hour**.
    <br>* I don’t oil the bowl. Dough expands better if it has something to hold onto. It also means I have to scrape the dough out of the bowl after rising.
    <br>** My best rise happens year around, in the microwave. Yes people get annoyed because they have to move it in and out to warm up their food. They don’t get rolls.  </li>
    <li>Line two baking pans with parchment paper, split the dough in two, set half aside.  Out of the 1/2 you are working with, form the dough into 12-18 equal-sized balls and lay on baking pan.  Do other half of dough.  Cover rolls with a clean dish towel, and let rise again for approximately an hour. </li>
    <li>A half hour into the rise, turn on the oven to 400 deg F. Bake for 8-12 minutes, until just golden. Rub cold butter on the tops of the warm rolls and serve. </li>
</ol>
