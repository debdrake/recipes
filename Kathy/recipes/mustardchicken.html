<h1>Mustard Chicken</h1>
<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 lbs. skinned, boned chicken thighs</li>
    <li>salt, pepper, paprika</li>
    <li>2 Tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>3 Tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>1/2 cup dry white wine (beer will do</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>bread crumbs</li>
</ul>
<h2>METHOD</h2>
Mix mustard, 1/4 cup wine and cayenne and set aside. Melt butter in broiling pan.  Put chicken thighs in pan, and season with salt, pepper, and paprika (go light on the salt, the mustard is pretty salty).  Broil for 5-6 minutes until brown.  Turn, season other side and broil. Turn, brush on mustard sauce, and sprinkle with bread crumbs.  Broil again until bread crumbs brown, 2-3 minutes.  Turn, repeat with sauce and bread crumbs and broil.  Remove to serving dish.  Pour in remaining 1/4 cup of wine and deglaze pan.  Pour over chicken.  Serve with pasta or rice.
