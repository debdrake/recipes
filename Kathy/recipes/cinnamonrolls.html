<h1>Cinnamon Rolls</h1>
<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
Dough
<ul>
    <li>3 c. warm water (150 deg F)</li>
    <li>5 c. flour3 1/3 tablespoons yeast</li>
    <li>1/3 cup melted butter</li>
    <li>1/3 c. sugar</li>
    <li>3 eggs, slightly beaten</li>
    <li>2 1/4 teaspoons salt</li>
</ul>
Dip
<ul>
    <li>3-4 c. sugar</li>
    <li>1-2 tablespoon cinnamon</li>
    <li>1 c. butter or margarine, melted</li>
</ul>
Icing
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 c. powdered sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
    <li>dash salt</li>
    <li>1/4 c. milk</li>
</ul>
<h2>METHOD</h2>
Put the warm water and a tsp of the sugar in a bowl.  Stir in the yeast until it dissolves.  Cover with plastic wrap then let sit for 10-15 minutes until yeast starts reacting (there should be some pretty good bubbling and foaming going on).  If the yeast doesn't react, throw it out and start over.  Add the rest of the sugar, the butter, salt, and eggs, along with 2 cups of the flour.  Beat until smooth with a whisk.  Switch to a spoon or spatula and add the next 2 to 2 1/2 cups of flour a half cup at a time.  When your spoon doesn't want to go through the mixture easily anymore, turn out on a floured surface and knead (press palms into ball of dough, then double over dough and press again) in the last half cup of the flour (if you need it).  Use plenty of flour on your hands, because this dough is meant to be on the sticky side.  As soon as you can get the slightly sticky dough kneaded into an fairly smooth, elastic ball, put it in a lightly oiled bowl, turn once to cover all sides with oil, and cover with a clean dish towel.  Let rise in a dark, room-temperature spot for 1 hour. Time to make the dough into rolls.  Get a couple of large baking pans ready.  I strongly recommend you line the pans with parchment paper.  This recipe made a parchment paper believer out of me, but if you insist on lots of scrubbing, you can oil & flour the pans. Also mix the sugar & cinnamon in a bowl, and have the melted butter handy.  Split the dough in two, set half aside.  Out of the Â½ you are working with, you can make either 12 or 18 buns, depending on how big you like them.  Split the dough into equal-sized balls.  Roll each ball out into a snake that is about 6 inches long. Dip it in the melted butter, and roll in sugar mix covering well.  Tie snake into a loose knot, then lay on baking dish.  Do other half of dough.  Cover rolls loosely with plastic wrap, then a clean dish towel (You don't have to use the plastic wrap, but it will keep your towels clean.)  Let rise again for an hour.  Bake at 350 deg. for 30-35 minutes, until just golden.  Mix icing ingredients until smooth, drizzle on buns and serve.
