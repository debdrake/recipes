<h1>Musubi</h1>
<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 recipe sushi rice</li>
    <li>3 sheets nori, cut in half lengthwise</li>
    <li>1 (12 oz.) can Spam</li>
    <li>1/3-1/2 cups aloha soy sauce</li>
    <li>Furikake, to taste</li>
    <li>chili flakes, optional</li>
</ul>
<h2>METHOD</h2>
<ol>
    <li>1. Cut Spam into 6 slices. Fry until slightly crispy (4 min each side). Pour a splash of soy sauce over each Spam slice, coating them in the mixture. Turn off heat and start assembling.</li>
    <li>Lay a sheet of nori lengthwise on the counter. Put a layer of rice in the musubi mold. Sprinkle rice with furikake (and chili flakes, if desired). Top with slice of Spam. Sprinkle with more fuikake, and add another layer of rice. Use the top of the Musubis press to press the filling together. Pull the outside of the press up and off of the rice/spam stack, I usually use a knife to slide off the top. Remember to always keep the rice covered by closing the rice maker, and rinse off the masubi press if it gets sticky.</li>
    <li>Starting at the end towards you, fold nori over Spam and rice stack, and keep rolling until completely wrapped in the nori. Slightly dampen the end of the nori to seal it. Repeat with the other Spam slices.</li>
