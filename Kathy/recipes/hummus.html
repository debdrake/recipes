<h1>Hummus</h1>
<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup chickpeas, dried, washed, and sorted</li>
    <li>6-8 clove garlic, whole</li>
    <li>1/2 onion, quartered</li>
    <li>2 bay leaf</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp. salt</li>
    <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
    <li>1-2 clove garlic, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp. salt, to taste</li>
    <li>1/2 cup tahini</li>
    <li>2-4 Tbsp. ice water, more, as needed</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp. EVOO</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp. cumin, ground</li>
</ul>
<h2>METHOD</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Cook chickpeas put chickpeas through the stock in an instant pot. Cook under pressure for 60 minutes, let naturally depressurize. Drain chickpeas, pick out onion, garlic and basil</li>
    <li>Combine the lemon juice, garlic and salt in a food processor. Process until the garlic is very finely chopped, then let the mixture rest so the flavors can mellow, > 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the tahini to the food processor and blend until the mixture is thick and creamy, stopping to scrape down any tahini stuck to the sides and bottom of the processor as necessary.</li>
    <li>While running the food processor, drizzle in 2 tablespoons ice water. Scrape down the food processor, and blend until the mixture is ultra smooth, pale and creamy. (If your tahini was extra-thick to begin with, you might need to add 1 to 2 tablespoons more ice water.)</li>
    <li>Add the cumin and the drained, over-cooked chickpeas to the food processor. While blending, drizzle in the olive oil. Blend until the mixture is super smooth, scraping down the sides of the processor as necessary, about 2 minutes. Add more ice water by the tablespoon if necessary to achieve a super creamy texture.</li>
    <li>Scrape the hummus into a serving bowl or platter, and use a spoon to create nice swooshes on top. Top with garnishes of your choice (drizzled olive oil, or paprika, or chopped parsley) and serve. Leftover hummus keeps well in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 1 week.</li>
