<h1>Sourdough Bread</h1>
<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups Sourdough Starter</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 - 2 cup flour</li>
</ul>
<h2>METHOD</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Stir starter, salt & flour.  Knead well.  Let rise for an hour.  Split into halves, shape into loaves & let rise for another half hour. Let the loaves continue to rise as you warm up the oven to 425 deg F, and put a cookie sheet full of ice on bottom shelf of oven.  Cook bread for 10 minutes on top/middle shelf, then lower oven temp to 400 deg F.  Cook for another 5-10 minutes. </li>
    <li>*I never have exactly 2 cups of starter, so I adjust the salt and flour accordingly. You want the dough to be kinda sticky after kneading, before the first rise, it will be easier to handle after rising. Use minimal flour to form the loaves. I knead dough with my Kitchen aid using the dough hook. I add about half the flour and run the mixer on slow while they combine. Run at a medium setting and add small amounts of flour until the dough doesnâ€™t stick to the sides. Knead for an additional 3-5 minutes at a medium setting. </li>


</ol>
