<h1>Wall Wash</h1>
<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 medium Poblano Peppers</li>
    <li>1 medium Jalapeno Pepper</li>
    <li>1 pound Tomatillos, husked, washed, and halved</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled</li>
    <li>1 cup cilantro, packed, rough chopped leaves and tender stems</li>
    <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp. lime juice, 1-2 limes, juiced</li>
    <li>salt & sugar, to taste</li>
</ul>
<h2>METHOD</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Roast Poblanos and jalape√±o peppers under a hot broiler turning occasionally to char and blacken all over. Place in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand until cool enough to handle, 10 to 15 minutes. Using paper towels, rub off charred skins, then stem and seed peppers. Transfer to the jar of a blender and set aside.  </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, place tomatillos on a baking sheet, cut sides down. Broil until they have charred and softened, about 10 minutes. Transfer to blender, along with any liquid. </li>
    <li>Add garlic, cilantro, chicken stock and lime juice and puree until smooth. Transfer salsa to a large bowl and season with salt and sugar to taste.SOURCE: Joshua Bousel</li>
