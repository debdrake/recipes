<h1>Bowl of the Wife of Kit Carson Soup</h1>
<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 lbs. leftover turkey, or 2 whole boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
    <li>1 quart chicken broth</li>
    <li>Pinch of dried leaf oregano</li>
    <li>1 cup cooked rice</li>
    <li>1 cup cooked garbanzo beans (dried or well drained canned)</li>
    <li>1 ripe avacado, peeled and cubed</li>
    <li>i chilpoltle chile, packed in adobo, minced, (or 1 small can chopped green chiles)</li>
    <li>whole pepper corns (about 15 or to taste)</li>
    <li>4 to 6 ozs Monterey Jack cheese, cubed</li>
    <li>4 sprigs cilantro (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2>METHOD</h2>
<ol>
    <li>1. If using turkey, then cube the turkey. Place the turkey or chicken breasts in a pot with the broth. If using chicken that has not been pre-cooked, then bring to boil, then turn off the heat, cover and poach for 12 min. Cut up chicken and return to broth. Add oregano, pepper corns, rice, gabanzo beans, and chiles.</li>
    <li>Quickly heat soup again to a quick boil, then ladle it into deep soup bowls. Garnish with a cilantro sprig, cheese cubes (to taste), and avacado (to taste).</li>
    <li>This dish may be made a day ahead, but don't add the avacado or cheese until reheating the soup for serving. The chipolte chile flavor will intensify overnight and the dish may seem hotter. For a more intense flavor, add some adobo from the peppers.</li>
