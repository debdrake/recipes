<h1>Seldovia Halibut Spread Sandwiches</h1>
<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1-2 fillets halibut</li>
    <li>Mrs. Dash</li>
    <li>1 Tablespoon butter or margarine</li>
    <li>mayo</li>
</ul>
<h2>METHOD</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Melt butter in frying pan.  Liberally coat both sides of skinned fish with Mrs. Dash.  Fry on both sides 4-6 minutes each side (depending on thickness).  Cool, shred, and mix with mayonnaise; add more Mrs. Dash for taste.</li>
    <li>1989, 1990 maybe? First time we had lunch provided on a halibut charter.  It was a B&B charter operation, the husband ran the boat, the wife ran the B&B and made the lunches.  The sandwiches were this spread in the middle of a small roll.  Simple, but delish!  Use as a sandwich spread or on crackers. SOURCE: Seldovia Fishing Adventures</li>
