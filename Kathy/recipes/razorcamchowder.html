<h2>METHOD</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Saute bacon until done. Remove bacon and save for later. Saute celery, onions, and garlic in bacon grease until soft. Add clams, and clam juice. Add water to make one cup of liquid. If you have more than a cup of clam juice, add it all. Bring to a boil, and simmer for 1 hour (or 20 minutes Instant Pot pressure cook, then quick release).</li>
    <li>When the clams are done, add the carrots and potatoes, add a little more water to cover, if necessary. Bring to a boil, and simmer for 15-20 minutes. (or 10 minutes instant pot pressure cook) While you are waiting for the carrots and potatoes, make a roux by melting the butter in a small pan, then add the flour, and cook until the flour browns a bit. When the vegetables are done, deglaze with a Tbsp or two of white wine, then add the roux, milk, cooked bacon, chicken broth granuels, parsley, and simmer at a low heat until thick and bubbly, 5-20 minutes. Just before serving, add some cream or whole milk (1/4 cup) to the pot and stir, check for seasoning.</li>
